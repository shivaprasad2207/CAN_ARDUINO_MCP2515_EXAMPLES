# Custom VM Template for ESP-WROOM32
#
# This template specifies parameters for using Zerynth with PCBs based on the ESP32 WROOM module.
# By changing the settings below, a custom GPIO routing, the peripheral list and many more details can be customized
#
# The format of the template is baed on YAML 1.2


# *short_name* will be used to identify the custom VM.
# This field is automatically set by the ZTC upon custom VM creation
# It must be at most 31 characters and must contain at most one underscore
short_name: XXXX_short_name_XXXX
# *layout* is set by the ZTC upon custom VM creation. Don't touch.
layout: XXXX_short_name_XXXX
# *cmacros* is a list of C macros that will be passed to the compiler
# during the compilation of a Zerynth project. 
# This section is prefilled with the correct values, but other can be added as needed.
# The macro VM_IS_CUSTOM **MUST BE PRESENT**, else the custom VM will badly crash.
cmacros:
    - ESP32_VHAL
    - ESP32_ETH_PHY_LAN8720
    - VM_IS_CUSTOM
# the *pinmap* section contains the list of physical pins with their Zerynth names.
# For each pin three parameters must be specified:
# - the Zerynth pin name: formed by adding a numeber suffix to a capital D (D0, D1,...).
#   The specified pin name will be available for use in Zerynth programs.
#   The order of pin names is not important, however we suggest to list them in order of increasing suffix.
#   The pin name list must not have gaps otherwise it won't compile (e.g. can't have D0,D1,D5 without D3 and D4)
# - the pin port: it must be a string specifying the microcontroller port for the pin. It can be one of PA,PB,PC,etc...
#   for the ESP-WROOM32 it must be PA because there is a single GPIO port in the module
# - the pin pad: it must be an integer number representing the microcontroller GPIO pad/index.
#   for ESP-WROOM32 for example, GPIO0 is represented [ PA, 0 ] and GPIO16 as [ PA, 16 ]
# NOTE: in ESP-WROOM32 pins from 6 to 10 are defined but can't be used because their are linked to the internal SPI flash.

# the *pinclasses* section specifies additional functionalities for each physical pin in the *pinmap* section.
# This section is composed of a dictionary where keys are "functional" pin names (e.g. A0, A1, RX0, SCL0, ...) representing a particular
# pin function, and values are the pin parameters.
# Here below the following pin classes can be found:
# - Analog class: all functional pin names in this class begin with a capital A and are followed by an index. The analog pin parameters
#   are specified in a list where the first item is the physical pin name associated with the analog pin, and the second item is the ADC channel
#   used by the pin (this value must be derived from the Espressif hardware documentation). 
# - SPI class: pins exposing a SPI functionality can have three different pin names prefix that defines the specific function in the SPI protocol: MOSI, MISO or SCLK (clock)
#   Spi pins need a single item as parameter, namely the physical pin exposing the Spi functionality. Spi pins are grouped in triplets, with each triplet sharing
#   the same pin index (e.g. MOSI0, MISO0, SCLK0 triplet specifies the pins used in the SPI peripheral)
# - I2C pins need a single item as parameter, namely the physical pin exposing the I2C functionality. I2C pins are grouped in pairs, with each pair sharing
#   the same pin index (e.g. SDA0, SCL0 pair specifies the data pin and clock pin used in the I2C peripheral)
# - Serial pins need a single item as parameter, namely the physical pin exposing the serial functionality. Serial pins are grouped in pairs, with each pair
#   sharing the same pin index (e.g. RX0, TX0 pair specifies the rx and tx pins used in the SERIAL peripheral)
# - DAC pins need two items as parameter, namely the physical pin exposing the DAC functionality and the DAC channel for the pin (to be found in Espressif hardware documentation)
# - PWM pins need a single item as parameter, namely the physical pin exposing the PWM functionality.
# - BTN pins need a single item as parameter, namely the physical pin connected to the button.
# - ICU pins are not available for the ESP-WROOM32 module yet
# - LED pins need a single item as parameter, namely the physical pin connected to the led.
#
# All functional pin names in this section will be available in Zerynth programs.

# the *peripherals* section contains the available peripherals and their details.
# In particular the below configuration exposes the following  peripherals:
#
# - SERIAL0, SERIAL1 and SERIAL2 are three serial ports with the specified RX and TX pins. The parameter "hw" is needed
#   to know which Serial port on the ESP-WROOM32 to use. hw is 1 for UART1, 2 for UART2 and 3 for UART3
# - SPI0, SPI1 are two spi buses, using the specified pins, The hw parameter is 1 for HSPI and 2 for VSPI
# - I2C0, I2C1, I2C2 are three i2c buses using the specified pins. The hw parameter is 1 for the i2c bus 1 and 2 for i2c bus 2.
#   Notice that the same hw index can be assigned to multiple I2C peripherals (e.g I2C1 and I2C2), meaning that in Zerynth programs
#   both I2C1 and I2C2 can be used, but obviously not at the same time.
# - RTC0 and HTM0 are specified in the template with correct values and must not be changed.

# the *device* section contains info for automatic device discovery.
# Most of the parameters have the correct values and must not be changed.
# The following parameters can be customized:
# - manual_reset: 0 or 1. If 1 the ZTC will pause asking the user to reset the device during registration, virtualization and uplinking
# - name: a string representing the human readable name of the custom device
# - reset_time: the number of milliseconds to wait for the user to manually reset the custom device
# 
# Two parameters that are missing in this template are:
# - vids: a list of uppercase hexadecimal numbers (not prefixed by 0x) representing the USB VID codes used for automatic discovery of the custom device
# - pids: a list of uppercase hexadecimal numbers (not prefixed by 0x) representing the USB PID codes used for automatic discovery of the custom device
#
# vids and pids can be discovered by opening the terminal, typing the command "ztc device discover" and searching your device
# vids and pids parameters make sense if the custom device has a usb-to-serial converter onboard linked to a serial port of the ESP-WROOM32
